# BioAUD
This study identifies dendritic cell-specific biomarkers for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) using scRNA-seq, RNA-seq, and bioinformatics. It reveals 82 DEGs, key hub genes, regulatory miRNAs/TFs, and enriched pathways. Potential therapeutic compounds were also predicted, supporting early diagnosis and treatment development for AUD.
